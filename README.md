- 👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub! Glad you're here to take a byte into the world of Tammy!
- 👀 I’m interested in most anything related to technology that aligns with STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cryptocurrency and blockchain development. I find them to be fascinating fields with immense potential. Not only in the technical aspects but the financial applications as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all available options that will provide me with the opportunity to acquire the skills and experience necessary to pursue and secure a career in my field of passion.
- 📫 How to reach me is fairly simple. You can send me an email, DM or connect with me on LinkedIn
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I would say I have a variety of hobbies. I tend to shift from one interest to another, always eager to learn more than just the basics, and my curiosity varies with the subject. It's not that I get bored easily; rather, I thrive on challenges and the analytical aspects. I've often expressed that I prefer to learn a little about a lot rather than a lot about a little!
